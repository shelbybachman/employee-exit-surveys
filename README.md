In this project, I used employee exit survey data from Australia, to examine data on resignations. Specifically, I found that although most employees who resigned were not dissatisfied in their workplaces, dissatisfaction levels were the highest among employees who had worked longer at their institutions before resigning, and among older employees.

Data for this project comes from exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment and the Technical and Further Education institute in Queensland, Australia ([source](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey)).
